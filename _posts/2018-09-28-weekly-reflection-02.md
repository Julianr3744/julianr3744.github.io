This week we analyzed a small videogame at this link https://www.wescheme.org/run?publicId=sggzRzgU5T. We analyzed the features of the game, such as what is changing in the game. We all noticed that the subjects in the game are all moving on the x axis, but only the cat can move up and down on the y-axis, and then move left and right on the x-axis. While the dog and clouds can only move left on the x-axis, meaning that the x-cordinate is decreasing.
