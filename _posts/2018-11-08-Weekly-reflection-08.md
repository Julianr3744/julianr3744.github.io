This week we learned more on defining functions. We identified whats the difference between different types, functions, and values. When we have types, we mean data types such as String, Number, and Image. We then analyzed different functions like gt, in which we gave gt a contract, which looks something like this ```;gt : number-> Image``` in where we take the function gt, describe what it takes in a number (domain), and produces an image (range).
