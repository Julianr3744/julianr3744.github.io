This week we learned about shapes. We messed around in wescheme in order to figure out hot to write code that outputs into a shape. We first identified some different shapes: stars, squares, rectangles, circles, etc. We first had to look at what changes a shape, the radius of the shape, the scale of the shape, the color, if it is an outline or not. We then had to figure out how to input it into the computer so we get the output we want. The next day, we take what we learned and started to do this with pairs, doing pair programming. One person drives, the person who is in charge of typing, and managing the computer. Then the other partner is the navigator, he checks for errors, thinking about the problem, and finding recources like our notes to help the driver. Jerome and I were partners, starting the first project, which was to create a square with a circle located at the right bottom corner. We overcame this task with the help of our notes from the previous day. I got more out of this than I though I would. This is going to be very useful when i continue to create my replication of the USSR National Flag.
