So this week we learned quite a bit. We talked about functions and their contracts. First we identified what differnt types of data there is in a contract. Thre are three types of data that we know of: Number, String, And image. When we looked at contracts, they were formated in this format ```function:domain->range```. Withen the domain, there are two types of data that fit in that section: a string and a number. The final product is the range, which as a type of data, is an image. This then forms a contract when all three are used. We then used this to our video game knoledge with the function bitmap/url, which takes a link with the image extention of jpeg, png, and gif and produces an image.
