So this week we worked on or next flag project. We started with getting our two flag options for a either a practitioner or profestional level. I picked the flag that could get me a practitioner level, which was the greece flag. The flag was of the 2:3 proportion, meaning the height always had to be in proportion to those numbers. For example, if i wanted to dilate it by a scale factor of 2, then i would have to make the width 4, and the length 6 to scale with that proportion. So my flag has 9 stripes going horizontally starting from blue to white, ending at blue. The next part is that there is a plus sign in the top left, the the box containing the plus is 5 stripes length. The plus is white, the sourounding it blue. Some of the questions i had about the flag was first considering the right color. There are many kinds of blue and I had to find a eye dropper tool in order to find the specific shade of blue. The next time I make this flag, I hope to get a little bit more acurate with my cuts. But overall i think i did a great job with my colors and the way the flag came out.
