## Summer Camp Course
- Here at this first session of CTY on the Roger William Campus, I took the Foundations Of Programming course at this site with my teacher being the one and only Matt Davis(aka Dictator Dave). My 3rd year at CTY was a blast with my entire class and many others. Being in this class taught me a lot. We went through processing(Java Derivitive), Python With Turtle, And Python. Starting off, not much of my computer knoledge was used because I was taught two completly different languages known as whescheme and pyret. I was able to see very little similarities in the languages i've been taught, but one thing for certain that they had in common: THEy weRenT EAsY. So with the conclusion of the wonderful three week class coming to the end, I had to make a final project. I was able to submit a program made with python on the website repl.it, an online coding platform. The link to my game is at the top, a short hundred lines of code made with the use of my knoledge from the course and help from my classmates and teachers.
