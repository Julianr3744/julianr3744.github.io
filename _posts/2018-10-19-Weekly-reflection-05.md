This week was a bit short for us, having the overnight trip to Princeton Blairstown Center. It was one hell of an experience, being out in the cold with all my freshman friends. We did a bunch of hiking around the area, went on a nightwalk, roasted smores, and watched the stars. But enough about that, in Intro To CS, we worked on image problems again. We worked with different functions that the computer already registered. The functions we used was an assortment of different shapes: rectangle, circle, ellipse, right-triangle, and radial star. Then we changed the outcome of the shape by plugging in numerical values for the size factor of the shape, and then inputed string statements to change the color and if the shape was an outline or not. The next function was the put-image function, what this function does is that it combines two different image functions. In order to work this one, the way it works is that you put the image you want on top, thenyou give it cordinates where the shape will center itself on. This overlays the images and makes them one image. I was able to get to 10.5 out of the 11 problems we had. I can connect this to the video game project that we are going to do because we are composing many images from online in order to make this project work. Put-image is going to be the function to string all of these images together.
